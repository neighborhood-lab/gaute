# Getting Started with Gaute Bot

## Overview

Gaute-bot is an automated GitHub account designed to assist with software development tasks while building API usage patterns to establish higher rate limits.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a testing sandbox where gaute-bot can:
- Perform legitimate development activities
- Build reputation with GitHub's systems
- Establish usage patterns for increased API limits

## Initial Setup

### For Bots
See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for bot configuration instructions.

### For Humans
1. Clone the repository
2. Review the documentation in `docs/`
3. Check scripts in `scripts/` for utilities
4. Read examples in `examples/` for common workflows

### Prerequisites
- Git installed and configured
- GitHub account with appropriate access
- Understanding of bot testing purposes

## Rate Limits

New bot accounts start with restricted limits:
- Core API: 60 requests/hour
- GraphQL: 0 requests/hour (initially blocked)
- Search API: 10 requests/hour

Through legitimate usage, these limits increase over time.
